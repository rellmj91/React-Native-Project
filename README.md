# React Native Project

*Introduction* - 
A [React Native](http://www.reactnativeexpress.com/environment) project using [Expo](https://expo.io).
You can find environmental setups via the provided links, this is part of my learning resources.

The purpose of this project is for training, familiarizing myself with ECMAScript2016, JSX and just React Native application development in general. 
This repository is fairly simple, which makes it very understandable to beginner or just anyone looking to grasp a concept not understood.

New features will be updated to the repository, changes will be made for look&feel and performance.
This application in general has no direct directions, as it is for training purpose.

Enjoy!
